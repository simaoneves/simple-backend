Simple-backend Responsive PHP Framework
==============
CMS made from scratch using Twitter Bootstrap and PHP.
The idea behind this project was to have a goto tool made by myself that i could use for various other projects, abstracting tiny problems so i could focus real tasks i have at hand.

PHP made with the help of tutorials ([phpacademy](https://www.youtube.com/user/phpacademy))
